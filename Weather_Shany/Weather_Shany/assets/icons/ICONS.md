# Weather Icons

This app uses emoji icons for weather conditions, which are embedded directly in the JavaScript code.

The icons are mapped to weather conditions as follows:
- ☀️ Clear
- ☁️ Clouds
- 🌧️ Rain
- 🌦️ Drizzle
- ⛈️ Thunderstorm
- ❄️ Snow
- 🌫️ Mist/Fog/Haze
- 💨 Squall
- 🌪️ Tornado

If you prefer to use image files instead, you can replace the emoji icons in `../script.js` with `<img>` tags pointing to image files in this folder.
